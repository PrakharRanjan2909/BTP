Summary of Flow and Motivation :

Need to Detect Abnormal Transactions
 Large fluctuations in crypto transactions, especially with significant sums, can affect investor interests.
 Prompt identification is essential to safeguard investors and ensure fair trading, which is both expected by investors and a responsibility of exchanges.
Correlation Analysis
  Recognizes that factors affecting transaction volumes vary between exchanges.
  Uses correlation analysis to identify and validate key variables influencing transaction amounts for each exchange.
Time Series Prediction with Deep Learning
  I have applied deep learning models with an attention mechanism for time series prediction.
  This approach offers a novel perspective on identifying anomalies within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
